A galaxy cluster weak-lensing mass modeling and verification code

This repository documents the work done within the SPT-WL working group and the LSST DESC Clusters working group to measure how weak lensing mass estimates relate to the true 3D mass of a cluster. The work focuses on emulating actual observations and mimicing procedures used by weak lensing observers. Mock observations are based on simulated lensing maps from n-body simulations.
