 abstract = "{We quantify the bias and scatter in galaxy cluster masses
M$_{200}$ and concentrations c derived from an idealized mock weak
gravitational lensing (WL) survey, and their effect on the cluster
mass-concentration relation. For this, we simulate WL distortions on a
population of background galaxies due to a large ({\ap}3000) sample of
galaxy cluster haloes extracted from the Millennium Simulation at
z{\sime} 0.2. This study takes into account the influence of shape noise,
cluster substructure and asphericity as well as correlated large-scale
structure, but not uncorrelated large-scale structure along the line of
sight and observational effects (e.g. the source redshift distribution
and measurement, and measurement of galaxy ellipticities). We find a
small, but non-negligible, negative median bias in both mass and
concentration at a level of {\tilde}5 per cent, the exact value depending
both on cluster mass and on radial survey range. Both the mass and
concentration derived from WL show considerable scatter about their true
values. This scatter has, even for the highest mass clusters of
M$_{200}$ {\gt} 10$^{14.8}$ M$_{âŠ™}$, a level of
{\tilde}30 per cent and {\tilde}20 per cent for concentration and mass,
respectively, and increases strongly with decreasing cluster mass. For a
typical survey analysing 30 galaxies per arcmin$^{2}$ over a
radial range from 30 arcsec to 15 arcmin from the cluster centre, the
derived M$_{200}$-c relation has a slope and normalization too low
compared to the underlying true (3D) relation by {\tilde}40 per cent and
{\tilde}15 per cent, respectively. The scatter and bias in mass are shown
to reflect a departure at large radii of the true WL shear/matter
distribution of the simulated clusters from the NFW profile adopted in
modelling the mock observations. Orientation of the triaxial cluster
haloes dominates the concentration scatter (except at low masses, where
galaxy shape noise becomes dominant), while the bias in c is mostly due
to substructure within the virial radius.
