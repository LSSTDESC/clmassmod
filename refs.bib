M$_{200}$ and concentrations c derived from an idealized mock weak
gravitational lensing (WL) survey, and their effect on the cluster
mass-concentration relation. For this, we simulate WL distortions on a
population of background galaxies due to a large ({\ap}3000) sample of
galaxy cluster haloes extracted from the Millennium Simulation at
z{\sime} 0.2. This study takes into account the influence of shape noise,
cluster substructure and asphericity as well as correlated large-scale
structure, but not uncorrelated large-scale structure along the line of
sight and observational effects (e.g. the source redshift distribution
and measurement, and measurement of galaxy ellipticities). We find a
small, but non-negligible, negative median bias in both mass and
concentration at a level of {\tilde}5 per cent, the exact value depending
both on cluster mass and on radial survey range. Both the mass and
concentration derived from WL show considerable scatter about their true
values. This scatter has, even for the highest mass clusters of
M$_{200}$ {\gt} 10$^{14.8}$ M$_{âŠ™}$, a level of
{\tilde}30 per cent and {\tilde}20 per cent for concentration and mass,
respectively, and increases strongly with decreasing cluster mass. For a
typical survey analysing 30 galaxies per arcmin$^{2}$ over a
radial range from 30 arcsec to 15 arcmin from the cluster centre, the
derived M$_{200}$-c relation has a slope and normalization too low
compared to the underlying true (3D) relation by {\tilde}40 per cent and
{\tilde}15 per cent, respectively. The scatter and bias in mass are shown
to reflect a departure at large radii of the true WL shear/matter
distribution of the simulated clusters from the NFW profile adopted in
modelling the mock observations. Orientation of the triaxial cluster
haloes dominates the concentration scatter (except at low masses, where
galaxy shape noise becomes dominant), while the bias in c is mostly due
to substructure within the virial radius.

for {\ap}10$^{4}$ cluster-sized halos formed in a {$\Lambda$}CDM
cosmological N-body simulation of a 1 h $^{-1}$ Gpc box. In
agreement with previous studies, we find that the scatter in the WL
masses derived using this fitting method has irreducible contributions
from the triaxial shapes of cluster-sized halos and uncorrelated
large-scale matter projections along the line of sight. Additionally, we
find that correlated large-scale structure within several virial radii
of clusters contributes a smaller, but nevertheless significant, amount
to the scatter. The intrinsic scatter due to these physical sources is
{\ap}20\% for massive clusters and can be as high as {\ap}30\% for
group-sized systems. For current, ground-based observations, however,
the total scatter should be dominated by shape noise from the background
galaxies used to measure the shear. Importantly, we find that WL mass
measurements can have a small, {\ap}5\%-10\%, but non-negligible amount of
bias. Given that WL measurements of cluster masses are a powerful way to
calibrate cluster mass-observable relations for precision cosmological
constraints, we strongly emphasize that a robust calibration of the bias
requires detailed simulations that include more observational effects
than we consider here. Such a calibration exercise needs to be carried
out for each specific WL mass estimation method, as the details of the
method determine in part the expected scatter and bias. We present an
iterative method for estimating mass M $_{500c }$ that can
eliminate the bias for analyses of ground-based data.

 abstract = "{Weak gravitational lensing provides a direct way to study the mass
distribution of clusters of galaxies at large radii. Unfortunately,
large-scale structure along the line of sight also contributes to the
lensing signal, and consequently affects the measurements. We quantify
the effect of distant uncorrelated large-scale structure on the inferred
mass profile of clusters as measured from weak lensing. We consider
Navarro, Frenk {\amp} White profiles, and find that large-scale structure
is a major source of uncertainty for most practical situations, when a
model, with mass M$_{200}$ and concentration parameter c as free
parameters, is fitted to the observations. We find that the best
constraints are found for clusters at intermediate redshifts (z\~{} 0.3).
For a cluster at z= 0.3, optimal results are obtained when the lensing
signal is measured out to 10-15 arcmin. Measurements at larger radii do
not improve the accuracy with which the profile can be determined,
contrary to what is expected when the contribution from large-scale
structure is ignored. The true uncertainties in M$_{200}$ and the
concentration parameter c are \~{}2 times larger than when distant
large-scale structure is not included in the error budget.

lensing profiles around massive dark haloes in detail, with a particular
emphasis on the profile at around the virial radii. We compare radial
convergence profiles, which are measured accurately in the ray-tracing
simulations by stacking many dark haloes, with our simple analytic model
predictions. Our analytic models consist of a main halo, which is
modelled by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile with three
different forms of the truncation, plus the correlated matter (two-halo
term) around the main halo. We find that the smoothly truncated NFW
profile best reproduces the simulated lensing profiles, out to more than
10 times the virial radius. We then use this analytic model to
investigate potential biases in cluster weak lensing studies in which a
single, untruncated NFW component is usually assumed in interpreting
observed signals. We find that cluster masses, inferred by fitting
reduced tangential shear profiles with the NFW profile, tend to be
underestimated by {\tilde}5-10 per cent if fitting is performed out to
{\tilde}10-30 arcmin. In contrast, the concentration parameter is
overestimated typically by {\tilde}20 per cent for the same fitting
range. We also investigate biases in computing the signal-to-noise ratio
of weak lensing mass peaks, finding them to be {\lsim}4 per cent for
significant mass peaks. In the appendices, we provide useful formulae
for the smoothly truncated NFW profile.

 abstract = "{We present an approximation for the average density profile of dark
matter haloes in the LambdaCDM cosmological model, which is accurate to
within 10--15\% even for large radial distances from 0.05R\_$\{$vir$\}$ up to
10R\_$\{$vir$\}$ for halo masses ranging from 10\^{}$\{$11.5$\}$ to 10\^{}$\{$15.0$\}$
h\^{}$\{$-1$\}$M\_$\{$Sun$\}$. We propose a modified form of the Navarro, Frenk {\amp}
White (NFW) approximation: $\backslash$rho(r)=$\backslash$rho\_$\{$NFW$\}$(r)+ A (r/R\_$\{$vir$\}$)\^{}$\{$-1$\}$+B
(1+r/R\_$\{$vir$\}$)\^{}$\{$-1$\}$. This generalized expression, which is applicable to
the external regions of dark matter haloes, only very slightly affects
the density in the inner regions of haloes. The strong correlation among
the different parameters in the model allows us to describe the profile
in terms of just one parameter: the virial mass. We integrate our
density profile to derive the enclosed mass in a sphere of a given
radius and compare it with the NFW results. We find that the NFW
underestimates the enclosed mass by more than 50\% at 10R\_$\{$vir$\}$, whereas
our model reproduces the results from numerical simulations to within 2\%
accuracy even at this distance. We also use this new approximation to
study the weak gravitational lensing and to obtain an analytic
expression for the tangential shear. This allows us to quantify the
contribution to the shear from the outer regions of the density profile.
For the first time we calculate the difference between the tangential
shear calculated via the NFW profile and the corresponding result when
the external regions of haloes in cosmological simulations are taken
into account. We find a 4\% difference for all the mass ranges under
study.
